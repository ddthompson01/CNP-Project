# CNP Project
## This project was created as part of my application for the Child Nutrition Program Analyst position at IDEA Public Schools. It showcases my skills in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel through various data analysis tasks. This project uses the School Nutrition Programs - Meal Reimbursement Information 2017-2018 dataset and specifically analyzes IDEA schools in Hidalgo County. The public dataset can be found **[HERE](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/school-nutrition-programs-meal-reimbursement-information-program-year-2017-2018): <br />
